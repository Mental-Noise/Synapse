# Mental Noise - Synapse - CV2MIDI Eurorack module

This repository contains the code and schematics (EasyEDA format) for the Mental Noise - Synapse Eurorack module converting CV signals to MIDI commands any MIDI instrument can understand.

I originally made this module to control my Korg Volca Beats but after some discussions on Reddit, I decided to make it more generic so it's able to control basically any MIDI instrument using different profiles for each instrument.

I have made this module to work with my modular synth but it can work with any control voltage source between 0 and +5V.

This module does not require the instrument to be modded in any way, it is just using the MIDI IN connection to transmit informations received from the CV inputs, it is complitely safe to use.

The Arduino code uses the standard [MIDI library](https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library/blob/master/src/MIDI.h) and the [ResponsiveAnalogRead library by dxinteractive](https://github.com/dxinteractive/ResponsiveAnalogRead), which can both be found in the Arduino Library Manager.

Custom profiles can easily be created to control your specific instrument.

The code is written to allow easy customization even for someone who doesn't know anything about writing code for the Arduino but has some ideas on how/what to control the Volca Beats.

If this module gets a bit popular, I might consider writing an app to easily modify the firmware without writing a single line of code.

## Module available on Tindie

As I would love for anyone who wants to use this module to be able to, I'm selling some kits and fully assembled modules (in limited quantities) on [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/stores/mentalnoise/).

The goal is not to make lot of benefits on this module, I'm already making it available for free here but if you don't have the skills to do it yourself with all the sources available here then it's a good way for you to get one!

If you don't want to buy the module but still want to support me, you can always send me tip on [paypal](https://paypal.me/atudoll), this is highly appreciated! :)

## Specifications

Checkout the [Documentation / Build guide](http://mentalnoise.atulrnt.com/Mental%20Noise%20-%20Synapse.pdf) for full specifications.

This module is designed to be used in an Eurorack system, it requires a +12V and a ground connection to the power supply.

The dimensions are:
- Width: 6HP
- Height: 3U
- Depth: 40mm

The MIDI device is controlled by this module using a MIDI cable (5-pin DIN connector).

Two types of inputs are available on the module:

#### CV x6
Analog input used to control parameters of the MIDI device. 
The MIDI command sent by those inputs is a Control Change.
Can be any voltage between 0 and +5V.
Higher voltages (up to +10V) will be clipped to +5V.

#### Gate x10
Digital input used to trigger a note on the MIDI device.
The MIDI command sent by those inputs is a Note ON.
A pulse of 20ms is triggered by any gate or trigger signal over 3V (up to +10V).
